1. The IMUL instruction (unsigned multiplication) can take two operands
as opposed to the MUL instruction only being able to take one. The cost
is that the result is truncated to fit the destination register's length. 
So that no significant bits are lost, it is good practice to immediatly 
check the CF {carry} or OF (overflow) flags. In this program, 
the maximum possible result of an IMUL instruction fits safely within
a single byte. Use of this instruction conserved the use of RDX and 
limited the number of MOV instructions.
